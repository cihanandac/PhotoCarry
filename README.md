# PhotoCarry
A program to copy certain photos from a pool and place it under a certain folders


This program is related to my other project "ExcelLink" (you can find in my repos). 
For being able to give links to the cells I needed to gather the related photos together,
so that the photo pool doesn't contain any unnecessary photo. 
Once the program runs you will choose the directory locations (from where to where) and 
excel file location. Then it pulls certain photos from a selected pool according to excel 
sheet. Photos will be copied to a directory of your choice, and will be seperated to 
different  folders with sheet names.

Feel free to use and share.
